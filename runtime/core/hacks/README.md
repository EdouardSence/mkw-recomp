# runtime/core/hacks

Shortcuts the console does not have, for playing and above all for developing faster. All off by default, each with
its `MKW_*` and its row in the "Hacks" tab (`ui/menu/settings_tabs.cpp`).

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `hacks.h` | The hacks' interface |
| `turbo.c` | Turbo (`MKW_TURBO` off/hold/toggle/on/until, `MKW_TURBO_SPEED`, F2 key): the pacer, the vsync thread and the guest clock (`rt_ticks`) run N times faster; the window shows at most 60 frames per second |
| `skip.c` | Skip movies (`MKW_SKIP_MOVIES`): presses A while a cup intro plays (`*Op.webm`), until the game closes its decoder |
| `seed.c` | Same randomness (`MKW_SEED=<number>`): the system entropy (svc `GetInfo 11`) and the 21 clock seedings of sead's generator (patch set `seed`) come from that seed: the title screen always shows the same course |
| `unlock.c`, `unlock.h`, `unlock_ids.c` | Unlock everything (`MKW_UNLOCK_ALL`): edits `Play/account.sav` when it is opened, like Ca1nM's save editor (MIT) |
| `freeze.c` | Freeze (`MKW_FREEZE_KEYS`, F3/F4; `ctl.sh NAME pause`, `step [N]`, `resume`): the game thread waits in its present |
